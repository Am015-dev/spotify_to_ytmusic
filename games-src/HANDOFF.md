# Handoff: start a new session from this file

Repo `Am015-dev/spotify_to_ytmusic`, branch `alex/brave-carson-rbpmlk` (never merge to main). The site is
published from `games/` at https://am015-dev.github.io/spotify_to_ytmusic/. Private research lives in
`Am015-dev/game-night-private` (never copy it into the public repo).

## Standing rules
- Never write an original game's, publisher's or designer's name in the public repo or the site. No model names
  in files or commits.
- A live game is replaced only after the owner OKs a preview (`games/<slug>-next/` or `thornbound-new/`).
- Don't edit the Mainhattan / Overdrive games; other sessions own them. Ticket to Ride is on hold.
- Read the root `CLAUDE.md` (lessons learnt + cost rules), then `games-src/BRIEF-2d-games.md`.

## Where things stand (4 Oct 2026)
- **Thornbound** is the quality pilot. It has blind playtests (`games-src/thornbound/playtest-1/`) and the spec
  `games-src/thornbound/CLARITY-PLAN.md`. A redesign is being built into `games/thornbound-new/`. Next: run 3 NEW
  blind testers with `games-src/scripts/drive-serve.js` against the acceptance bar in the plan; iterate; then
  show the owner.
- **Previews waiting for the owner:**
  - hollowbough-next (with the shared kit)
  - kaiten-kitchen-next
  - crown-city-smash-next
  - final-approach
  - cauldron-fair
  - lantern-dive
- **Shared kit:** `games-src/shell/gx-kit.js` (reference drawer, settings, undo, recap, stats). The guide is
  `games-src/shell/GX-KIT.md`.
- **Kit rollout to the other games: PAUSED.** 7 cloud sessions were stopped; their partial work is on branches
  `rollout/*`. Resume only with the clarity standard from Thornbound, one game at a time.
- **Audits:** `games-src/AUDIT-SUITE.md` and each game's `AUDIT-PRODUCT.md`.
- **Shelf:** the 3 new games are not on it yet. To add them, run `games-src/room/add-new-games.py` (covers are
  ready).
- **Art:** the owner will make art with Google Flow later; each game has a prompt list in `ART-PROMPTS.md`.
